We've created a database for a documents app, with rows for each document with it's title, content, and author. In this first step, use UPDATE to change the
author to 'Jackie Draper' for all rows where it's currently 'Jackie Paper'. Then re-select all the rows to make sure the table changed like you expected.

CREATE table documents (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    author TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO documents (author, title, content)
    VALUES ("Puff T.M. Dragon", "Fancy Stuff", "Ceiling wax, dragon wings, etc.");
INSERT INTO documents (author, title, content)
    VALUES ("Puff T.M. Dragon", "Living Things", "They're located in the left ear, you know.");
INSERT INTO documents (author, title, content)
    VALUES ("Jackie Paper", "Pirate Recipes", "Cherry pie, apple pie, blueberry pie.");
INSERT INTO documents (author, title, content)
    VALUES ("Jackie Paper", "Boat Supplies", "Rudder - guitar. Main mast - bed post.");
INSERT INTO documents (author, title, content)
    VALUES ("Jackie Paper", "Things I'm Afraid Of", "Talking to my parents, the sea, giant pirates, heights.");

SELECT * FROM documents;

UPDATE documents SET author = "Jackie Draper" WHERE "Jackie Paper"; 

SELECT * FROM documents; 

DELETE FROM documents WHERE id = 5;

SELECT * FROM documents;
