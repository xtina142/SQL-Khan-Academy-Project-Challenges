We've created a database of clothes, and decided we need a price column. Use ALTER to add a 'price' column to the table. Then select all the columns in each row to see what 
your table looks like now.

CREATE TABLE clothes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    type TEXT,
    design TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO clothes (type, design)
    VALUES ("dress", "pink polka dots");
INSERT INTO clothes (type, design)
    VALUES ("pants", "rainbow tie-dye");
INSERT INTO clothes (type, design)
    VALUES ("blazer", "black sequin");

    
ALTER TABLE clothes ADD price INTEGER; 

SELECT * FROM clothes; 

UPDATE clothes SET price = 10 WHERE clothes.id = 1; 
UPDATE clothes SET price = 20 WHERE clothes.id = 2;
UPDATE clothes SET price = 30 WHERE clothes.id = 3; 


SELECT * FROM clothes; 

INSERT INTO clothes (id, type, design, price) VALUES (4, "hat" , "straw" , 40);

SELECT * FROM clothes;
